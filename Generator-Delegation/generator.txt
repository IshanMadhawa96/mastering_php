It is a common practice to work with large datasets as a PHP developer.
For example, to retrieve data from an API endpoint and store it into an array so later we can iterate over 
the array and manipulate the data according to the specific needs. Even though this can be fairly common practice, 
sometimes the dataset can increase in size so much that it can cause memory overflow.


In cases like this when we have a big dataset or we expect the data to increase in the future,
generators can come to the rescue. A generator in PHP is a function that allows us to iterate over data 
without needing to build an array in memory. Unlike a standard function, which can return only a single value,
a generator can yield as many values as it needs to.

When a generator function is invoked, as a result, we get a Generator object that can be iterated over. 
For example, if we use the foreach loop to go through the object, 
PHP will call the generator function each time it needs a value, 
then saves the state of the generator when the generator yields a value 
so that it can be resumed when the next value is required. Once there are no more values to be yielded, 
the generator function behaves the same as when an array has run out of values.
